# Architecture

The main architecture of this project lies within the `pages/` and `assets/` directory. The `pages/` directory consists of webpages that make up this website: the [about page](/studious-lamp/about), [this page](/studious-lamp/architecture), and the three pages that make up the project form (the form, preview, and result pages). For a seasoned programmer, they should be relatively easy to understand. The bulk of this documentation will explain the various files in `assets/`, especially the key Javascript files that runs the form.

## `utility.js` and the createState() function

## `project-form/` directory

## `project-preview/` directory
